# Language learner

The original goal of the project was to facilitate language learning process. At the current stage of implementation project allows
to take an audio track with a dialogue (actually any audio can be used, including music), import a transcipt for it
and bind each part of the transcript to a specific parts of an audio file. This helps a great deal in improving language
perception, listening skills. The original idea was to help me with in understanding of Irish accents and my French studies :)

The project also provides a feature of instant translation (french to/from english).

## The structure goes as follows

- angularjs-client-deprecated - the original AngularJS client UI project
- client - Angular 2 client which was meant to replace AngularJS client. There is nothing there so far, just some experiments with Angular 2 
- restful - Play/Scala based RESTful API with integration tests

## Divertion
After having developed this project for several months I decided to expand its features from just being a language listening
skills coach to a comprehensive TOOL for learning languages which could be used both by teachers and by students.

Unfortunately I'm having free time shortage at present, as all my time is taken by work, family, and my studies. I postponed this 
project temporarily but as soon as I have more free time I'll resume it.
